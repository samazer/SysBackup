     [a+logo.png] Note: The most up-to-date copy of this file is
     available in the [1]SysBackup Documentation and FAQ pages on the
     [2]AzerTech.net web site. Source code documentation was previously
     being generated using phpdoc; work has begun to switch over to
     Doxygen. The results so far can be found in the
     [3]/doc/doxygen/html/ folder within the distribution tarball.

Requirements

   PHP was chosen for this project because it has become the most popular
   scripting language in the world. Unfortunately, even though the LAMP
   stack has become wildly popular on the internet, PHP is not installed
   by default on many servers and workstations. Begin by checking your
   system to verify that you have PHP v5.1 (or higher) installed:

$ php -v
PHP 5.1.6 (cli) (built: Nov 29 2010 16:47:46)
Copyright (c) 1997-2006 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2006 Zend Technologies

   Modern Linux distros very often ship PHP in dozens of small packages.
   At the very least you will want to make sure that you have installed
   the command line version of PHP. The package names differ from
   installation to installation:
     * For Debian/Ubuntu-derived distros look for the php5-cli package.
     * For Redhat-derived distros look for the php-cli and php-process
       packages.

   If you forget to install the php-process package on Fedora 15 you will
   get a

     PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function posix_geteuid() in
     lib/general-sysutils.inc

   Again, sudo yum install php-process will solve this problem.

   Notes:
     * SysBackup is a simple PHP script. In principal you do not need root
       permissions to run it. You can use SysBackup to easily produce
       backups of files in your system account. It follows, however, that
       you will need root access to backup other user accounts, the root
       folder and other system-related bits and pieces of a full server or
       workstation.
     * Most of the various configuration files are themselves PHP scripts.
       If you are not familiar with PHP please take the time to find out a
       bit about PHP. The manual is available at
       [15]http://www.php.net/manual/.

   If you plan to use the SSH Remote feature to write backups to a remote
   server you will need to make sure you have SSH properly installed on
   your system. Most Linux distros install OpenSSH by default but not all.
   If you are using a Debian derived distro (ie: Ubuntu) and find that the
   OpenSSH server is not installed you can install the openssh-server
   package. For detailed information follow the instructions here:
