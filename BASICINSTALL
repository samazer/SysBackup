                                                        \-- sysbackup.conf
                                                                 /var/log/
                                                         \-- sysbackup.log

   This process is relatively simple. It consists of unpacking the
   SysBackup package into a convenient location (we'll use /opt/sysbackup/
   for this example, then setting-up two folder trees: one for
   configuration information and another for storage of backups. For this
   example we'll be using /etc/sysbackup/ to store the configuration files
   and /home/sysbackup/ to store the backups. Please refer to the sample
   directory listings on the right while reading the instructions below.

   Once the setup is completed you will want to edit the sysbackup.conf
   configuration file to reflect your setup.

   The last step in the process is to actually configure your backup jobs.
   See the existing job configuration files in the conf.d folder for
   detailed information about backup job configuration. See also the
   [4]JOB-CONF file more details.

  Quick Install

   In fact the following process is so simple that a script called
   quick-install is available to do most of the work for you. Simply
   unpack the distribution tarball in an appropriate location (the
   examples here all use /opt/sysbackup/,) execute the
   /opt/sysbackup/quick-install utility and follow the instructions.

   If you execute quick-install as root it will perform the setup
   described in this Basic Installation document. If you execute the
   script as a system user it will setup SysBackup to run in
   /home/<user>/sysbackup.

  Let's get started

                                                          [15]Be Prepared!

    1. Start by unpacking the SysBackup tarball into an appropriate
       folder. For this example we will use /opt/sysbackup/.
    2. Next you will want to setup your configuration folders and files.
       For this example we will use /etc/sysbackup/.
    3. Create a subfolder to hold any ssh key files that you might need in
       the future: /etc/sysbackup/keys.
    4. Create a subfolder to hold the job configuration files:
       /etc/sysbackup/conf.d.
    5. For now you can create a symlink from /etc/sysbackup/plugin.d to
       the /opt/sysbackup/plugin.d folder. This will ensure that your
       installation will load all the distribution plugins. In the future,
       when you update the distribution files in /opt/sysbackup your
       installation will load the updated plugins. Create this symlink in
       the usual way, ie: ln -s /opt/sysbackup/plugin.d
       /etc/sysbackup/plugin.d.
    6. Create a folder for temporary storage. For this example we will use
       /home/sysbackup/temp.
       The underlying partition will require enough disk space to hold the
       largest tarball in your backupset. (Start with lots of disk space
       if possible. You can be more careful later.)
    7. Create a storage folder for your daily backup rotation. By default
       the backup folders have the format <Backup Path>/<Host
       Name>/Rotation. Therefore, for this installation we will use
       /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/daily.
       Again, there is a disk space issue to consider when setting-up your
       backup procedure but you can deal with that issue later.
       One point to consider immediately: The files in the temp folder
       will be moved to the daily folder if you choose to keep a local
       copy of your backupset. Keeping the two folders on the same
       partition can reduce significantly the time it takes to complete a
       backup.
    8. If you plan to keep weekly and monthly rotations you will need to
       create folders for those also. For now we will assume
       /home/sysbacup/test.azertech.net/weekly/ and
       /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/monthly.
       Available disk space is the main consideration yet again. Perhaps
       more important is the ability to use hardlinks between identical
       files in the daily, weekly and monthy rotations. You will use less
       disk space if you can keep all the backups - daily, weekly and
       monthly - on the same partition so that identical files can be
       hardlinked to save space.
    9. You can now copy the main configuration file and start editing it:
       cp /opt/sysbackup/sysbackup.conf /etc/sysbackup/. The file contains
       comments that will help you to understand the various items that
       you need to configure.
   10. SysBackup will log a limited amount of information to
       /var/log/sysbackup.log during each backup run. Create the log file
       as follows so that SysBackup can write to it:

$ sudo touch /var/log/sysbackup.log
$ sudo chmod 666 /var/log/sysbackup.log

       The chmod command above is only necessary if you plan on running
       sysbackup without root permissions.
       At the time of this writing there is no configuration option for
       changing the location of the log file - you will have to edit the
       code for now if you need to change the log file location.

   This completes the software and folder setup. At this point the
   SysBackup script will run but it will not do much for you. To get the
   right results you need to configure the backup jobs that you want
   SysBackup to execute for you.

   Look through the sample job configuration files in
   /opt/sysbackup/conf.d/ and symlink any that you think you can use, ie:
   ln -s /opt/sysbackup/conf.d/mailman.conf
   /etc/sysbackup/conf.d/mailman.conf. If you find one that you want to
   use but you see that you need to edit it you can copy it instead: cp
   /opt/sysbackup/conf.d/homedirs.conf /etc/sysbackup/conf.d/ and edit it
   for your purposes.

   See the [16]JOB-CONF file for information on the structure and meaning
   of these files.
