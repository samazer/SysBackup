SysBackup v3.018alpha

   2012.01.18 SA:

      * bug#475: Added code to call the can_hardlink() method during
        the VFS startup procedure (after finding the prev. backupset.)
        This allows the system to use brute-force to determine if
        hardlinks can be used between the current and previous
        backupsets. The resulting information is then compared against
        the config info and, if the configured value is not the same
        as the computed value, a warning is issued and the value is
        set to the computed value. Note that the rotation plugins
        perform a similar check on startup.

      * Fixed some library bugs that had disabled the logger and the
        display output capture to file.

      * Added logging of the caller IP in the /var/log/remote-exec.log
        file. Also added the log($msg), sysexec(&$out,$cmd),
        getenv($var) and getenvironment() methods to the remote
        filesystem code.

SysBackup v3.017alpha

   2012.01.15 SA:

      * Added some help text and fixed an embarrasing bug in the
        recently added command line argument handling code (forgot to
        list the --dump-config and --exec options... was up too late
        last night.) Fortunately nobody downloaded any copies so will
        re-post the correction as the same v3.017a.

      * Fixed some calls to code that did more than just sanity
        checking when the app was in sanity-check mode.

      * Changed a number of fatal errors into warnings so that users
        can now run sysbackup without root permissions. All the sanity
        checks will fail and warnings will be issued but the user will
        eventually get the new help text.

SysBackup v3.017alpha

   2012.01.14 SA:

      * bug#485: Added the general-args.inc module to handle command
        line argument handling - including some error checking
        (bug#476)

      * Added the quick-install utility that automatically installs
        SysBackup. Some parameters, such as TimeZone, are not set
        automatically yet. Many parameters, such as the Rotation
        settings, contain default values that the administrator might
        want to adjust.

SysBackup v3.017alpha

   2012.01.12 SA:

      * Update documentation & many minor bugfixes. Also made some
        minor adjustments to the code after a quick review to correct
        some structural issues that crept-in recently.

SysBackup v3.016alpha

      * major improvements, some bugs found and fixed, full rotation
        implementation completed. switched from phpdoc to doxygen (but
        did not update all the comments - lots of work to do there.)

      * bug#491: rotations now work properly. ie: if the
        weekly/monthly backupset is being written to a different
        partition the logic exists to make use of hardlinks on that
        partition. Also the backupsets are now being pruned. This
        logic applies to the sshremote NAS storage as well as the
        local storage.

      * bug#506: backupsets are marked as INCOMPLETE during
        processing. The INCOMPLETE flag is removed when the backupset
        is fully written.

      * bug#498: added the dump users plugin and associated job
        configuration. Very easy to complete because the code was
        written long ago for the mail server.

      * installed a define for the name of the internal plugin.

      * added the exec method for the internal plugin which can exec a
        system command

      * bug#502: fixed a bug where the system would cycle through the
        transfer queue even when there are no remote servers
        registered.

      * bug#487: added some log messages to keep track of sysbackup
        usage.

      * removed the sysbackup-specific internal plugin code from the
        General Plugins library - moved it into the sysbackup
        override.


SysBackup v3.015alpha:

   2011.12.14 SA:

      * more last-minute minor changes in the docs (very minor)

SysBackup v3.014alpha:

   2011.12.14 SA:

      * last-minute minor changes in the doc: added ohloh widgets and
        fixed a problem with some image tags.

SysBackup v3.013alpha:

   2011.12.14 SA:

      * Bug#503: Fixed a bug in the code that added the sysbackup
        script path to the include path list.

      * updated the script that converts the ./doc/*.html files into
        their corresponding ./* text files.

      * made some minor changes to the documentation for clarity.

      * removed some unnecessary links to doc files in the base script
        folder and added comments in the text versions of those files
        to encourage the reader to look in the ./doc/ folder. Removed
        the LICENSE link to the doc/gnu-license-files/agpl.txt file
        and replaced it with a copy the same file.

      * updated the script that creates the sysbackup-distrib folder,
        copies the AFORMs library into the lib folder and updates the
        local copy of the github repo. (This is necessary because
        sysbackup is actually part of a collection of old server-maint
        scripts and is separate from the AFORMs library folder. The
        two need to be combined to produce the packages that get
        pushed to github and sourceforge.)
