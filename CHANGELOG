SysBackup v3.013alpha:

   2011.12.14 SA:

      * Bug#503: Fixed a bug in the code that added the sysbackup
        script path to the include path list.

      * updated the script that converts the ./doc/*.html files into
        their corresponding ./* text files.

      * made some minor changes to the documentation for clarity.

      * removed some unnecessary links to doc files in the base script
        folder and added comments in the text versions of those files
        to encourage the reader to look in the ./doc/ folder. Removed
        the LICENSE link to the doc/gnu-license-files/agpl.txt file
        and replaced it with a copy the same file.

      * updated the script that creates the sysbackup-distrib folder,
        copies the AFORMs library into the lib folder and updates the
        local copy of the github repo. (This is necessary because
        sysbackup is actually part of a collection of old server-maint
        scripts and is separate from the AFORMs library folder. The
        two need to be combined to produce the packages that get
        pushed to github and sourceforge.)
