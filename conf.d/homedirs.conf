 *
 * HomeDirs backup Configuration
 *
 * This file adds a job to the sysbackup genbackups event. The job
 * produces:
 *
 * - tarballs for each subdir within a home dir and 
 * - it compresses any files found in the home dir. 
 *
 * The files are named in such a way that it is easy to see where they
 * came from. 
 *
 * The sysadmin can specify folders to include and folders to exclude. 
 *
 * Folders which contain many subfolders that do not get updated often
 * can be specified as individual home dirs. Each subfolder in these
 * directories will be compressed into a separate tarball. The use of
 * hardlinks for identical tarballs in multiple backup rotations will
 * save disk space and network bandwidth.

/**
 *
 * Include /home/ Directories
 *
 * Edit this list to match the locations of user home-type directories
 * on your server. If you have several collections of user directories
 * (ie: email, web roots, databases, etc.,) you can list them all
 * here.
 *
 * <p>In the case of /home/ directories a separate tarball will be
 * created for each user (sub-directory) found unless that directory
 * is listed in the "exclude" array. This is intended to make it
 * easier to extract files for a particular user when necessary.
 *
 * /home/ Directories to Exclude
 *
 * An array of directories to exclude from the backup of the /home/
 * directory. This is a simple array of directory names such as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * "exclude" = array( "/home/tom",
 *                    "/home/jerry",
 *                    "lost+found",
 *                  );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note that lost+found should always be specified in the
 * home_exclude_dirs along with any folders that should not be
 * backed-up (ie: generated content that can easily be generated again
 * in the event of a disaster.)
 *
