/**
 *
 * MySQL database to backup.
 *
 * Normally the host name is <i>localhost</i> but it can be set to any
 * IP to backup any database server. 
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING:</b> 
 *
 * Do not use the MySQL backup in this script if your database might
 * be updated while the backup is running!
 *
 * <p><b>ONCE AGAIN:</b> Do not rely on the MySQL database backup
 * procedure in this script unless you are certain that your table
 * data will remain constant while the backup is running.
 *
 * The MySQL backup procedure provided here is very simple. It is
 * possible to run this backup without first locking your
 * databases. 
 *
 * <p><b>THIS IS YOUR THIRD AND FINAL WARNING:</b> If an update
 * operation occurs while a database backup is running it is possible
 * that some of the updated data will be written to the backup while
 * some is not. The resulting backup would then contain errors.
 *
 * <p>One possible solution to the problem is to bring down your mysql
 * server for a moment, create an LVM snapshot of the partion that
 * holds the mysql data, then restart the mysql server again. Finally,
 * you can run another mysql server against the snapshot (use a
 * different port number for the second server instance.) This way you
 * will be certain that nobody will issue any updates via the second
 * database server and your dump will be valid.

 * completed in a few seconds and your application can be coded to
 * handle it gracefully. A second database server can then be booted
