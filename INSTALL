     being generated using phpdoc; work has begun to switch over to
     Doxygen. The results so far can be found in the
     [3]/doc/doxygen/html/ folder within the distribution tarball.

Overview

   Please take a moment to review the [15]System Requirements before
   installing SysBackup.

   At the moment there are two basic types of installation:
    1. [16]Basic Install: The current server/workstation is backed-up to
       local (or mounted) storage.
    2. [17]SSH Remote Storage: The current server/workstation is backed-up
       to remote storage via SSH/SCP. Optionally a copy of the backup can
       also be stored on the local (or mounted) filesystem.

   You will always begin with the [18]Basic Install This is relatively
   quick and easy to do. The basic Install involves mostly just the
   creation of various folders on the system.

   Setup of [19]SSH Remote Storage involves setting-up the SSH
   communications (installing the key files,) and installing the local
   exec utility script on the remote server. The Local Exec utility is
   included, along with a test script called Remote Exec, in the SysBackup
   package.

  Jobs & Plugins

   Once the basic software has been installed you will need to install and
   enable the plugins that you want to use. At the time of this writing
   there is a small collection of plugins available in the plugin.d/
   folder. Hopefully that collection will grow over time. Each plugin is a
   small and simple script that is designed to perform some kind of common
   task. For example the mysql.plugin script is designed to backup a MySQL
   database server, the mailman.plugin script is designed to backup a
   mailman installation, etc.

   Once you get to know about the different plugins you can setup the jobs
   you need to properly backup your server or workstation. Again,
   setting-up the backup jobs is fairly easy. Job configuration scripts
   are really just little scripts that schedule calls to the plugins.

   In many cases you can configure a backup process that does everything
   you need to do using the plugins that are available. In some cases you
   might need additional functionality. If so you can review the code for
   one of the existing plugins and write a plugin to simplify the task you
   are trying to complete.

Getting Started

   The new Quick Installation script (in the distribution tarball) can be
   used to quickly get SysBackup organized on your server or workstation.
   You can find the manual [20]Basic Install procedure in the BASICINSTALL
   document or on the AzerTech.net web site.

   Follow the instructions in the REMOTESTORAGE document to setup [21]SSH
   Remote Storage of your backups.

  Be Prepared!

   [22][main-use-case.png] SysBackup can be configued to backup specific
   information and services. Installation and configuration is relatively
   simple. From there the generation of a backupset is a one-step
   automated process.

   Unfortunately keeping a simple set of backups does not mean that you
   are prepared for all the different information restore issues you might
   face over a period of years. For helpful hints on how to make sure you
   are as prepared as possible please take a look at the [23]BE-PREPARED
   document.

   You might also want to check out the [24]SysBackup Documentation and
   FAQ pages on the [25]AzerTech.net web site.
