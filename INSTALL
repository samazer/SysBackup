                                                           [9]Be Prepared!

   The basic Installation of SysBackup involves mostly just the creation
   of various folders on the system. Setup of remote storage involves
   setting-up the SSH communications and installing the
   remoteexec/localexec utility scripts (which are included in the
   SysBackup package.)

   Most people will try to read this INSTALL document without first
   reading the [10]README file. If you are one of these people you may be
   under the mistaken impression that SysBackup is a plug-and-play backup
   tool. It is not. You can't just drop it into a system and expect it to
   take care of backups for you. The instructions below are relatively
   simple and, if you use the included job configuration files, you will
   be able to generate a backupset very quickly - but it may not have much
   value. Please take the time to review the [11]README, and
   [12]BE-PREPARED documents before you try to use this software. You
   might also want to check out the [13]SysBackup Documentation and FAQ
   pages on the [14]AzerTech.net web site.

Installation Assumptions

   The instructions below will guide you through the process of installing
   SysBackup. The text will make references to the computer being
   backed-up and two different remote storage servers. To keep this text
   simple it will refer to a few assumptions about what you, the reader,
   are doing:
     * [installation-components.png] You are learning about SysBackup by
       installing it into a virtual machine for test purposes. The
       hostname for this virtual server is test.azertech.net.
     * Your test VM has limited disk space. Therefore you will only keep
       one backupset on the test VM. The backup rotations will be sent via
       SSH to the physical host for the VM. You also need an external copy
       of your backups. These will be written to a NAS server, nas. The
       hostname for your physical host is dom0.azertech.net and the
       hostname for your network storage is nas.azertech.net.
     * You want to install SysBackup Version 3.01a into your /opt/ system
       folder. The resulting installation folder name is
       /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a.
     * Your backupsets will be stored in /home/sysbackup/.
     * Your SysBackup configuration information will be stored in the /etc
       system configuration folder at /etc/sysbackup.

   Before you try to complete the installation it's a good idea to read
   the [15]README file, the various comments in the main sysbackup.conf
   configuration file and the information in the [16]JOB-CONF help file.

   Feel free to run the sysbackup script at any time using the
   --dump-config option, like this:

     $ sudo /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/sysbackup --dump-config

   This will cause the script to load all configuration files and plugins.
   It will then try to intialize itself and all the plugins before
   displaying the resulting dump of the configuration. During this
   initialization process the various libraries and plugins will execute a
   variety of sanity checks. The code is designed to error-out whenever a
   problem is found. The idea is that you should get a fatal error
   immediately if there is something wrong. Of course, in practice, not
   all of the plugins will be able to detect all possible problems on
   initialization - but they should try.

Installation Procedure

   We will procede with the following steps:
    1. Installation of the SysBackup scripts on the test VM.
    2. Creation of various folders that SysBackup will be using and
       copying of some needed configuration files.
    3. The /etc/sysbackup.conf file must be edited to allow sysbackup to
       run properly
    4. Job configuration files need to be created (in /etc/conf.d/) for
       each step in the backup process.
    5. Installation of the RemoteExec/LocalExec scripts (included in the
       SysBackup package) on the dom0 and nas remote storage servers.
    6. The /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf files on each remote server must be
       edited to tell sysbackup where to write backupsets.

   NOTES:
     * In most cases the installation will be performed by the system
       administrator and usually requires root access.
     * The PHP language was chosen for this software because it is so
       popular. This software requires the command line version of PHP. It
       is often called php-cli in popular repositories. Please ensure that
       it is properly installed before trying to complete this
       installation.
     * This software has been tested only with PHP 5.3 and may not
       function correctly with earlier versions of PHP.
     * Most of the various configuration are themselves PHP scripts. If
       you are not familiar with PHP please take the time to review the
       docs at [17]http://www.php.net/manual/.

   So let's get started now with the actual installation:

  On the test VM

   Please remember, as per the [18]assumptions made above, to replace
   names and paths below with the correct values for your installation.
    1.

                                                                   +-- conf.d/

                             /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/mysql-localhost.conf
                                                    | +-- package-list.conf ->
                                /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/package-list.conf

                                /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/squirrelmail.conf

       | \-- syswebfiles.conf -> /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/syswebfiles.conf
                                                                     +-- keys/
                                                                | +-- filecopy
                                                            | +-- filecopy.pub
                                                               | +-- localexec
                                                           | \-- localexec.pub
                               +-- plugin.d -> /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/plugin.d/
                                                            \-- sysbackup.conf
       Start by unpacking SysBackup into /opt/.
    2. Next create a folder in /etc to hold all the SysBackup
       configuration files: /etc/sysbackup.
    3. Create a subfolder to hold ssh key files: /etc/sysbackup/keys.
    4. Create a subfolder to hold the job configuration files:
       /etc/sysbackup/conf.d.
    5. Although it's not entirely necessary these instructions will assume
       a symlink to the plugins folder as part of the sysbackup
       configuration. Create this symlink in the usual way, ie: ln -s
       /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/plugin.d /etc/sysbackup/plugin.d.
    6. Create a temp storage folder such as /home/sysbackup/temp. The
       underlying partition will require enough disk space to hold the
       largest tarball in your backupset. (Start with lots of disk space -
       you can be more careful later.)
    7. Create a storage folder for your daily backup. The backup folders
       have the format <Backup Path>/<Host Name>/daily. Therefore, for
       this installation we will use
       /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/daily. Again, there is a disk
       space issue to consider when setting-up your backup procedure but
       you can deal with that issue later. One point to consider
       immediately: The files in the temp folder will be moved to the
       daily folder if you choose to keep a local copy of your backupset.
       Keeping the two folders on the same partition can reduce
       significantly the time it takes to complete a backup.
    8. If you plan to keep weekly and monthly rotations you will need to
       create folders for those also. For now we will assume
       /home/sysbacup/test.azertech.net/weekly/ and
       /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/monthly. Available disk space is
       a consideration yet again. Perhaps more important is the ability to
       use hardlinks between identical files in the daily, weekly and
       monthy rotations. You will use less disk space if you can keep all
       the backups - daily, weekly and monthly - on the same partition so
       that identical files can be hardlinked to save space.
    9. You can now copy the main configuration file and start editing it:
       cp /opt/sysbackup-v3.01/sysbackup.conf /etc/sysbackup/. The file
       contains comments that will help you to understand the various
       items that you need to configure.
   10. Look through the sample job configuration files in
       /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/ and symlink any that you think you
       can use, ie: ln -s /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/mailman.conf
       /etc/sysbackup/conf.d/mailman.conf. If you find one that you want
       to use but you see that you need to edit it you can copy it
       instead: cp /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/conf.d/homedirs.conf
       /etc/sysbackup/conf.d/ and edit it for your purposes. Do this for
       each of the provided sample job configuration files. See the
       [19]JOB-CONF file for information on the structure and meaning of
       these files.

  On the Remote Storage Servers

   The procedure for the remote servers is similar to the above procedure
   in the sense that the sysbackup scripts need to be copied to the server
   and some folders need to be created. Additionally, the server being
   backed-up will access the filesystems on the remote servers through SSH
   and a utility called localexec. Localexec is designed to remotely
   execute standard PHP filesystem functions and return results that are
   formatted as if the function call was local.

   One last detail: SSH keys must be generated for both SCP and localexec.
   The keys need to be copied to both servers. The remote storage server
   must also be configured to run the localexec utility when called by the
   key reserved for localexec.

   Note that the remote storage of backupsets is handled in the same way
   as local storage. The main difference is that remote storage servers
   may be storing backupsets from many servers and, obviously, need more
   disk space to handle the additional data.

   The installation steps to follow are listed below. Please remember, as
   per the [20]assumptions made above, to replace names and paths below
   with the correct values for your installation.
    1. Start by unpacking SysBackup into /opt/.
    2. Create a new user called sysbackup, ie: sudo useradd -m sysbackup.
    3. Create a temp storage folder such as /home/sysbackup/temp.
    4. Create a storage folder for your daily backup. For this
       installation we will use /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/daily.
    5. If you plan to keep weekly and monthly rotations you will need to
       create folders for those also. For now we will assume
       /home/sysbacup/test.azertech.net/weekly/ and
       /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/monthly.
    6. In ~sysbackup/.ssh/ create two ssh keys:


$ ssh-keygen -f localexec
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in localexec.
Your public key has been saved in localexec.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
1b:12:c3:01:1a:93:2b:42:43:a1:6a:db:64:98:45:78 sysbackup at nas.azertech.net
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|.o=o...          |
|.+oE . .         |
|o +o  +          |
|+ =    o         |
|o= o  . S        |
|. =    . o       |
| . .    .        |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+

$ ssh-keygen -f filecopy
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in filecopy.
Your public key has been saved in filecopy.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
b4:61:ed:2d:68:cb:87:1b:5f:ce:a1:5f:18:a1:f2:ef sysbackup at dev.azertech.net
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|         .       |
|        + . .    |
|       o = o .   |
|        S + o    |
|       o = . o   |
|        = o + .  |
|         = * o   |
|        . ooE    |
+-----------------+


       Note that, for general convenience, there are no passphrases used
       in the above example.
    7. Next, add the public keys to the authorized_keys2 file:

$ echo 'command="/opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/localexec $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ' \
               `cat localexec.pub` >> ~sysbackup/.ssh/authorized_keys2
$ cat filecopy.pub >> ~sysbackup/.ssh/authorized_keys2

       Note that the localexec key triggers the localexec utility. The
       SysBackup code will not work unless this is done. Check the
       documentation for OpenSSH for additional information about keys and
       local commands. Check the internet for help with setting-up
       chrooted OpenSSH user accounts.
    8. Copy the private keys to the /etc/sysbackup/keys/ folder on
       test.azertech.net.
    9. Edit the file /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf on each new sshremote server.
       The file should contain the following information:

path_temp=/home/sysbackup/temp/
path_backup=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/
path_rotation=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/

       Remember to change the /home/sysbackup path to reflect the path
       that you are really using on your sshremote server. The SysBackup
       utility will replace the %HOST% token with the host name of the
       server being backed-up.
   10. Verify the setup of the sshremote server by using the remexec
       utility test.azertech.net:

$ /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/remexec /etc/sysbackup/keys/localexec \
                                   sysbackup [at] nas.azertech.net \
                                   readfile /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf
path_temp=/home/sysbackup/temp/
path_backup=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/
path_rotation=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/

   11. Edit /etc/sysbackup/sysbackup.conf on test.azertech.net to include
       the new sshremote server.

$this->add_remote( "nas", new backupvfs_sshremote_c( $this, array(
   "enabled"               => true,
   "remote_server"         => "nas.azertech.net",
   "remconf_file"          => "/etc/sysbackup-nas.conf",
   "usehardlinks"          => true,
   "ssh_localexec_keypath" => "/etc/sysbackup/keys/localexec",
   "ssh_localexec_userid"  => "sysbackup",
   "scp_filecopy_keypath"  => "/etc/sysbackup/keys/filecopy",
   "scp_filecopy_userid"   => "sysbackup",
                                                                  )));

   12. Then run SysBackup with the --dump-config option to verify that the
       new sshremote server is properly configured:

$ sudo /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/sysbackup --dump-config

  int scp_filecopy_userid      "sysbackup"
  int remote_server            "nas.azertech.net"

...


   13. At this point your sshremote server is ready for action.

   Repeat the above steps for each remote server you need. In most cases
   you will want to backup your VM to the physical host and, separately,
   to at least one remote host (on or offsite.)

Final checkout and first backup

   At this point you should be able to dump the sysbackup configurtion
   without any problems:

     $ sudo /opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/sysbackup --dump-config

   You should now be able to run the backup and see the desired results.
   Here's the output from a test run on a dev workstation:

$ sudo ./sysbackup --dump-config --exec

   NOTE: The stars (*) in the above output indicate that a file was
   hardlinked instead of being copied. This does not save any time on the
   local filesystem but it saves a great deal of time on the remote
   filesystems under SSH as only the SHA1 hash and link command go over
   the network.

Going Further

   In practice there are many backup scripts that you can download from
   the internet - and many highly sophisticated backup tools available -
   but none of them are able to take the time to review your server and
   your requirements to find out what you really need. For example: is
   your server running 24x7? If so, how do you backup your databases or
   your mail services, for example? One good way to do it is to stop all
   services for a few seconds in the middle of the night so that you can
   take snapshots of the filesystem using, for example, LVM. Then you can
   restart all the services and run your backups off of the snapshots.

   It takes time to organize all this and get it running smoothly. Please
   take a moment to contact the author, Sam Azer, with your questions,
   comments and suggestions. Hopefully system administrators will find
   SysBackup to be a helpful tool in their toolbox.
