<p><i>This is a short introduction to SysBackup, a </i>swiss-army-knife<i>-type utility that helps
simplify and organize the nightly backup tasks. It allows the
system administrator to quickly and easily script jobs that tarball
folders and compress files into a backup set.</i>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>As system administrators we are faced with a variety of problems on
our servers from day to day. Over long periods of time we experience
different issues with our user community and our equipment. This leads
us to recognize a variety of different needs and, in general, try to
meet them with little scripts.  We run these little scripts every
night in the hope that we might be better prepared for the days
ahead. After a while, though, the scripts start to get
complicated. Then, when disaster does strike again - and it will - we
find out the hard way that things didn't quite work out as
planned. There are always minor details that conspire against
us (often just simple system software upgrades and changes
in the behavior of the user community.) The problems also tend to
happen most when we are most confident that we are doing what we need
to be doing - which leads to much embarrassment. This forces us to
review the backup procedure and make more adjustments.

</td></tr></table>The ultimate solution is an iterative business process combined
with a simple but flexible collection of tools. The business process
will include regular reviews and disaster recovery exercises to ensure
that everything is running smoothly. What we want from the backup tool
is to:

<ul>

<li>easily perform simple tasks, such as tarballing specific folders
  or collections of folders, quickly and conveniently,

<li>intelligently execute common tasks such as backing-up a
  well-known service.

<li>allow us to simply, quickly and easily add to and adjust the overall
  procedure in response to day-to-day issues.

</ul>

<p>SysBackup is a <i>swiss-army-knife</i>-type utility that helps
simplify and organize the nightly backup tasks. It allows the
system administrator to quickly and easily script jobs that tarball
folders and compress files into a backup set. The jobs are really
easy to setup.

<p>The jobs make use of a collection of plugins that are designed to
simplify common tasks. Some of the plugins, such as the MailMan
Mailing List Plugin, help the administrator perform several related
tasks by configuring one simple backup job. Some of the plugins, such
as the MySQL plugin, understand a specific service and are able to
correctly extract data from that service. This allows the more general
SysBackup software to make valid tarballs from the MySQL data.

<p>The resulting backup sets are conveniently organized into daily,
weekly and monthly rotations. Each backupset contains a set of
sub-folders containing, hopefully, everything related to a
particular service or user.

<p>Note that SysBackup uses plugins for such tasks as encryption of
backupsets and SSH access to remote storage. This allows the behavior
of SysBackup to be changed by simply making use of different plugins
as needed.  Most important: The plugins are really easy to write. If
you need something you don't see you might find that you can script it
yourself in a few minutes.

<p>Together these tools become a powerful and effective solution to
the day-to-day problems faced by a system administrator. At the same
time, SysBackup is simple and flexible enough that new jobs, possibly
involving new plugins, can easily be added as new issues are
identified.


<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>

<li>SysBackup was written for Linux. It will run fine under Cygwin or
XAMPP and the sys-tarballs class can be configured to use zip instead
of tar or pax. Then again there are many Windows backup solutions
available and they tend to understand the Windows Registry and NTFS
file attributes - issues that SysBackup makes no effort to address.
  <br />
  <br />

<li>SysBackup is not a plug-and-play backup utility. You can't just
install and run it - it won't do anything for you unless you take
the time to think about what you need and configure the jobs and
plugins to do what you need them to do.
  <br />
  <br />

<li>SysBackup is not a bit-copy utility. In theory you could setup a
job that tarballs an entire server or workstation - but that's not
what SysBackup is designed to do. There are other solutions available
for bit-copy operations. For example:

  <ul>
    <li>On Amazon AWS you can make
bit-copies of your VM's using the Create Image function available
through the web-based GUI.
    <li>On physical VM hosts you can simply take a
snapshot of the VM's storage and compress it to create a bit-image of
an entire server.
    <li>On physical workstations and servers you can boot a
SysRescCD.org CD and use Partition Image to bit-copy an entire host
over to network storage.
    </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Be Prepared!</h2>

<p><img

>It's always a good idea to make some kind of backup - having copies
of data is better than not having copies - but any experienced system
administrator will tell you that backups are not, by themselves, very
useful. Blindly running a backup utility is not the same as being
prepared for the day-to-day issues that your organization will face
over a period of years.

<p>The goal of any serious backup process is to <b><i>be
prepared</i></b>.  An experienced system administrator wants to make
sure that any piece of equipment (server or workstation) is setup so
that users will be able to get what they need, when they need it, for
different types of <b><i>restore operations</i></b>. This often means
being able to go back in time and:

<ul>
  
  <li>find copies of files that users have accidentally changed or deleted (sometimes undetected for days, weeks or months,)

  <li>help users recover from long-term data value degradation caused by malware and software bugs,
  
  <li>restore a service or services that have been damaged by software upgrades,
  
  <li>migrate a server to a new host,

  <li>comply with regulations concerning long-term storage of data

  <li>and respond to regulatory agency requests for otherwise expired information.

  </ul>


<p><i>SysBackup</i> is a simple, flexible and efficient tool that you
can use to help you get the results you need - but only if you plan
the process, test it and adjust it to ensure that you are, in fact,
getting what you need!
