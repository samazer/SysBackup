Basically the process of writing the backups is not much different from the case where a rotation is being copied to a separate partition. Hardlinks don't work in this case so it's necessary to check the previously written rotation folder to see if there are any identical files that can be hardlinked on the other partition. The process is essentially the same as the process for registering a tarball with the main backupset during a backup.  </a><b>Copyright</b></p>

This is intended to help automatically manage disk space. Configuration information inherited by this class is not actually used - this class refers to the config info in the associated localio VFS object.  Note that these rotation plugins are not actually loaded as plugins or as virtual filesystems. These are objects that interact with the corresponding VFS objects. They are implemented as separate VFS plugins so that they can load hash tables for the rotation folders using the same code that is used by the VFS plugins.  </a><b>What's a Rotation anyway?</b></p>
<p>Many years ago backups were written to tapes - large reels of tape. Tape was expensive and difficult to work with. It would become unreadable if it got crinkled and there were many little problems that would cause the tape to go flying off the reel and end-up all over the floor in a big mess. In my personal case I only used reels of tape for music in the 70's. By the 80's tape had fallen out of favor among audiophiles and tape cassettes had become the more common format. Data, however, was still being recorded on large tape reels.</p>
<p>Personally I did not start using tape for data backup until some time in the 80's when data cartridges became popular - so I never really had to suffer the horror of big reels of data tape all over the office floor. However I did have my share of problems with data cartridges. They were a huge improvement over reels of tape. They were easier to use and the tape rarely came out of the cartridge where it belonged. Still, cartridges were expensive and, again, the tape would easily become unreadable after being used a few times.</p>
<p>So, we needed to be able to record our nightly backups onto the cartridges without having the tape get crinkled and become unreadable. Unfortunately the cartridges were painfully expensive. We didn't have enough money to go out and buy one cartridge for each day of the year. The most effective course of action was to buy as many cartridges as we could afford and use them sequentially. When we got to the end of a stack of cartridges we would go back to the first one and start again. This was called a ROTATION and it allowed all the previously used tapes in the stack to be available in case of a problem.</p>
<p>In practice the tape would get crinkled and the cartridges would be found unreadable after a few uses. If the previously recorded backup had become unreadable due to crinkles in the tape... we just tried the one before that, and so on, until we found one that was readable. Sometimes we would manage to recover some files from one cartridge and would look for more files on other cartridges. This was not fun.</p>
<p>We also used additional weekly and monthly rotations. This was in part to extend the duration of the backup so that backupsets covered a longer period of time. However, it was also a way of ensuring that the cartridges would last longer before becoming unreadable.</p>
<p>The rotation process for the weekly and monthly backups was as simple as the daily rotation process: Every Sunday the tape from the previous Sunday would be rotated into a weekly backup stack. Every month we might (if we were able to purchase enough cartridges,) also rotate the weekly backup from the start of the previous month into a monthly backup stack. Each week the expired weekly and monthly cartridges would then go back into the daily rotation. This ensured that there were always tapes in the daily rotation that were less heavily used and, therefore, more likely to be reliable.</p>
<p>As you can imagine this was a frustrating exercise. Consequently tape cartridges were never really very popular. Over time the cost of hard disk drives had gone down to the point where some companies starting using hard disk storage instead of tape storage in their backup rotations. I had one customer in the 90s who had a computer dedicated to the task of making backups. The drive bays on that computer were all removable. The president of the company would take one weekly backup home on Friday night and, on Monday morning, would return with the previous weekly backup drive and put it back into the company hard disk rotation. This ensured that the company would have an off-site backup available (in his home) in the event of a disaster at the office.</p>
<p>In the current age of LVM snapshots, inexpensive hard disk storage, Network Addressable storage and Cloud-based storage there are a wide range of backup options available. It is now possible to take a snapshot of a busy filesystem, back it up to a long-term local rotation and copy it simultaneously to remote storage - possibly even off-site.</p>
<p>The availability of a long-term rotation on a local server improves dramatically the response to typical user issues (especially if the backup is fine-grained.) A user who has accidentally deleted a file, for example, might not realize for several days that he has a problem. When he does finally call the I.T. department for help the daily rotation may have expired - but a copy of the file might be found on the weekly and/or monthly rotations. By keeping the backups as fine-grained as possible it is easy to find an appropriate tarball and make it available to a user whenever necessary.</p>
<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p>Files are added to this Virtual File System as they are for the localio Virtual File System. However, the LocalIO VFS must be allowed to work as quickly as possible to ensure that filesystem snapshots are released quickly. Therefore the rotations plugins are designed to queue any files that need to be copied and copy them after the main backupset is created.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">On load this plugin determines if it must write weekly or monthly backups and sets appropriate flags.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">On startup this plugin follows the same procedure that was followed by the localio plugin except that it operates on the rotation folder instead of the backup folder. In other words it finds the previously written backupset in the Rotation folder (if any) and loads the associated hashlist.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">If weekly and/or monthly rotations are being written: All files written to the main backupset are copied to the weekly and/or monthly rotations. Hardlinks are always used if the same partitions are used by the backup and rotations folders. If the partitions are different the current hashlist is used to determine if an exact copy of a file already exists in the previously written backupset on the rotations folder. If so a hardlink is used; if not the file is queued for later copying.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">When all other tasks are completed the following tasks will be executed:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) All queued file copy operations will be completed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) The daily, weekly and monthly folders will be pruned. See the notes below. Pruning is not done before the backup in case the process fails. This ensures that there is at least one good backup available on the local filesystem (the previous one, if any.) Unfortunately this requires that local filesystems, if they will be keeping any local copies of backups at all, require enough disk space available at all times for at least two complete backups. (If this is a problem on some VM's the last backup can always be removed before creating the next backup.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Pruning Folders</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This plugin takes a simple approach to managing rotations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Daily rotations are pruned every day. The total number of folders allowed in the Daily rotation folder (the folder where the backupsets are written each day,) is limited to the number of folders specified in the $this-&gt;app-&gt;localsys-&gt;rotation_total_daily configuration parameter. The folders are sorted by creation date and all but the most recent total_daily folders are deleted.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">On one day of the week (specified in the $this-&gt;app-&gt;localsys-&gt;rotation_dayofweek configuration parameter,) the backupset that was just created is copied to the weekly backup rotation. If the weekly rotation is stored on the same partition as the daily rotation the copy will consist of hard linked files that do not actually use any significant disk space.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Weekly rotations are pruned as with daily rotations. The $this-&gt;app-&gt;localsys-&gt;rotation_total_weekly configuration parameter defines the number of recent weekly backupsets that are maintained.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">On one day of the month (specified in the $this-&gt;app-&gt;localsys-&gt;rotation_dayofmonth configuration parameter,) the backupset that was just created is copied to the monthly backup rotation. This rotation can also be hardlinked to save disk space.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Monthly rotations are pruned as with weekly rotations. The $this-&gt;app-&gt;localsys-&gt;rotation_total_monthly configuration parameter defines the number of recent monthly backupsets that are maintained.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>

These are objects that interact with the VFS objects.  See the notes in the header of the localio rotation plugin. This plugin is intended to be identical but operates on a remote filesystem.  This plugin is called after a file has been copied to the ssh remote NAS server. It is intended to determine how best to create a weekly or monthly rotation. Each rotation is actually a separate backupset in the case where hardlinks are not available - so the code operates as if it is creating a new backupset.  The situation is quite simple if it is possible to use hardlinks between the daily rotations and the weekly rotations. In this case the necessary folders are created and hardlinks are written as the backup progresses.  Otherwise the rotation plugin loads the hashlist for the previously generated backupset in the rotation. It attempts to save disk space via hardlinks between files in the new weekly backupset and the previous weekly backupset using the same logic as the local I/O backup plugin. If no identical file is found the remote server is instructed to make a copy of the file from the daily rotation to the weekly or monthly backupset.  </a><b>Copyright</b></p>

The idea is that all plugins will use the same set of simple methods to move files and tarballs of files into the backup set. Those methods will then deal with the issue of copying the files into the local, remote or both file stores. The plugins therefore don't need to know anything about the backup set - they only need to know about the job they are trying to perform.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Procedure</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The basic procedure will be as described below. The backup system will instantiate a master class that will keep track of all target filesystems to be used see the notes below about VM's that backup to dom0 as well as a separate NAS device.) Each different filesystem will be managed by a class that will be able to do the following:</p>

<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Note that this backup software will often be running on a Virtual Machine with limited available disk storage. In many cases the VM will need to backup directly to the dom0 while using the minimum possible disk space on the VM. However, the dom0 is not suitable for use as remote backup storage. In most cases the backup script will also be forced to send the same backup set to a NAS device on the network. Finally, after creating the full backup set on the dom0 and the NAS device, this script will also need to trigger a synchronization process between the local NAS device and an offsite storage server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As such the backup VFS must be able to operate on the local filesystem as well as two different remote filesystems.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The code to perform the various steps of the backup is found in the plugins folder. The MySQL plugin, for example, is needed to perform a backup of a MySQL server. The various jobs executed as part of the backup process are listed in the configuration folder. Each configuration file represents a backup job. Again, for example, you can backup a MySQL server by copying the MySQL configuration file into the configuration directory. Make two copies of it to backup two MySQL servers. In each case the information required for the job, such as server IP, backup user id and password, is stored in the configuration file for the job.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jobs are assigned to Events. When the event is triggered all the jobs that have been assigned to it are sorted by Job ID (a user defined string) and executed one-by-one. Each job is executed by the plugin specified in the Job configuration.</p>

<p>sysbackup  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html</a> AGPL  2011 by Sam Azer, All rights reserved <a class="el" href=""><a href="http://www.samazer.net/about">http://www.samazer.net/about</a>  Dump Users  </a>Utilities to help with migration of a server</p>
<p></p>
<p>This script should read the password &amp; group files in the specified directory and emit a number of UserMod commands that, when executed on a new server, will effectively recreate identical account information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Usage</b></p>
<p><code>dumpusers [dir] &gt;recreate-users.sh</code></p>
<p></p>
<p>The <em>dir</em> parameter tells the script where to look for copies of the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, etc. files. Often this is a directory on the new server containing a copy of the /etc/ directory from the original server. If the script is run without any parameters it will attempt to read the original files in the /etc/ directory.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The output from the script is itself a script. It should be saved to a convenient file and reviewed for accuracy. If all goes well the script will recreate all the users and groups from the original server on the new server (not including the system users and groups which are most often not needed.) Output from the script looks something like the following sample:</p>
<pre></pre><pre> #
 # Account dump from /etc/ on dev3
 #</pre><pre> # fredjones
 groupadd --gid 1000 fredjones
 useradd --gid 1000  --uid 1000  --home-dir "/home/fredjones"  --comment "fredjones"  \
         --groups "cdrom,pulse"  --password "..."  --shell "/bin/bash" -M fredjones</pre><pre> # fredsmith
 groupadd --gid 1001 fredsmith
 useradd --gid 1001  --uid 1001  --home-dir "/home/fredsmith"  --comment "fredsmith"  \
         --password "..."  --shell "/bin/bash" -M fredsmith</pre><pre> </pre><p></p>
<p><b>Warning</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This script does not take into consideration several bits and pieces of information that are legal in the various password, group and shadow files. Review carefully the output from the script and, if necessary, take the time to either modify the output manually or update the script to properly handle the information that is not currently handled.</p>

<p>System maintenance scripts that operate from a remote server often use SSH to perform operations on remote file systems that can't be mounted.

<p></p>
<p><b>GENERAL NOTES</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The current code has been completely re-organized and is no longer compatible with the code in sysbackup-v3015a or prior versions. Please note that this is still alpha quality code (ie: it's not feature complete) and there's a chance that there might be some more changes. Specifically any plugins that were written during the past month or so might have to be updated and your /etc/sysbackup/sysbackup.conf file will need to be edited with care. Finally the /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf file on your remote NAS server needs some minor editing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Redhat/Fedora distros</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>PHP on Redhat (and also on Ubuntu) is distributed as a large number of small packages. At this time I do not have a list of the packages required to run sysbackup. If you get strange error messages about functions not found it's a safe bet that you need to install a PHP package. Note also that this code has been tested on fairly recent versions of PHP5 and probably won't work on anything less than v5.3.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Time Zone setting</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you forget to set your local time zone in your PHP ini file you will get a warning from PHP. Unfortunately this warning prevents the remote exec / local exec tools from functioning correctly. The code has been updated to look in the INI file for a setting and, if none is found, use New York (Eastern Standard Time) by default. This avoids the warning message but might result in incorrect times being logged.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Log Files</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you sudo touch /var/log/remote-exec.log and sudo chmod 666 /var/log/remote-exec.log you will be able to check the log file for usage and error messages. Otherwise logging is disabled. Don't forget to update your logrotate settings if you use this feature.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>ABOUT PHPDocumentor</b></p>
<p>Please note that PHP Documentor will not parse many of the files in this package unless it has been patched. For information on how to make the necessary changes see the FAQ:</p>
<p>PhpDocumentor 'not a PHP file' issues</p>
<p>in the FAQ section on AzerTech.net under Software Development <a href="http://www.azertech.net/content/view/53/29/">http://www.azertech.net/content/view/53/29/</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Original Goals:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The basic goal of this script has always been to take a picture of the server every night - in a way that makes it easy to find any file that might be needed. In addition this picture must be complete enough that it can be used to build a new server in the event of a disaster or during migration. Not surprisingly it often happens that equipment upgrades are usually scheduled to occur more frequently than disasters!</p>
<p></p>
<p>To make this possible it must be easy for the system admin to list all the items that need to be backed-up. The script should be smart enough to check if the item exists on the current server and make a backup of it - or not bother if it doesn't exist. This is because there may be more than one server with similar but not identical configuration. To save time the backup script must be smart enough to live in one repo but run on the various similar servers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The backups should be saved in a rotation on the current server. The script must also be able to save a rotation on one or more remote servers. There should be separate daily, weekly and monthly rotations to ensure that long term backups are readily available (long term rotations are often helpful in cases where a problem causes damage that is not readily apparent.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>If two tar files are identical between backups the script should be able to detect the situation and replace the second copy with a hard link to the previous identical copy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Current Status</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>GOOD</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Modular design of v3 is a huge benefit: Plugins are easy to write and backup jobs are easy to configure. Most needs can be met by creating a simple job configuration script that calls on the various plugins to do the work. In practice there won't be much need to write new plugins.</p>

<p class="startli"></p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>BAD</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">This is a total re-write so the code will need to be reviewed a few more times. Performance and usability issues will need to be reviewed also (especially since many features are missing at the time of this writing; ie: the ability to specify different configuration files in the command line.) In spite of all the recent testing there is no doubt that more bugs will be found.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Many of the sanity checks in v2 are not included in v3 because of the modular design. The local VFS code, for example, doesn't check to see if there's a remote system configured or not. So if there's no available local disk space the local VFS doesn't try to perform the backup in remote-only mode as it did in v2 (at the time of this writing. It may be possible to set the keeplocal flag to false for each VFS object that finds it does not have enough space - then the application can test for any VFS objects that are working and error out if none are available.)</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Error handling code for this initial implementation doesn't send emails or try to complete the backup in cases where problems are detected. Most detected problems simply result in a fatal error.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>

<p class="startli"></p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"></p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>UGLY</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Lots of command line options needed but little time to add them. It's hard (not currently possible) to change the behavior of a backup run on the fly. At the moment it is necessary to edit the job configuration to change the backup behaviour.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The use of named parameters passed as $option arrays to methods and their parents simplifies much of the code - but makes it difficult to detect errors. The new named parameters class helps quite a bit but the issues are not fully resolved.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The code makes little effort to manage spaces, quotes and double-quotes inside tarball file names. The code to manage this issue has been improved dramatically since this note was first written but the support for spaces in the backupset file and folder names has not been tested. Note that this problem affects only files generated by the backup software. The files and folders being backed-up have no name restrictions of any kind.</p>

<p><b>Installation</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>See the INSTALL and <a class="el" href="sysbackup_8conf.html">sysbackup.conf</a> files for help with installation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Verification</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>From time to time it is important to verify that everything is actually working as expected. Several steps must be performed to ensure that the verification is valid.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What's the difference between a warning and a fatal error here?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Answer: There are two answers to this question:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) You will often see a few warnings that contain informat about an error. These are often followed by a fatal error. The entire message is actually a fatal error but the warning method is called for the information and the fatal method is called at the end with the final error message. This is a coding issue (fatal stops the program execution and so can only be used once at the end.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) In principal the backup app must stop for configuration errors and sanity check errors. If there's something strange going on we assume that the system is either not configured properly or there's something seriously wrong that must be corrected before the backup system is allowed to run - so stop and let the admin fix it before trying again. Warnings are for problems that do not prevent the completion of the backup.</p>
<p>In practice it's not always easy to decide between the two when writing the code. After the code has been written there are problems that the admin might start to want to see as warnings instead of fatal errors and vice-versa.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This file started out as a super simple bash script called /etc/cron.daily/daily.sh on a dev server used by Sam Azer. It is supposed to be short and straight-forward but circumstances cause it to grow a little from time to time. It has been used on BNT servers and servers belonging to various customers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The code was first published in the Bell Integrator Build &amp; Run server maintenance manual in 2002. The ability to write nightly backups to an off-site server was added a few years later.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rewrite as a PHP script was prompted by the complexity of the daily.sh script running on mail2.bnt.ca. There are too many operations being performed in that script (including general server status and anti-spam reporting.) It became obvious that it would be necessary to separate the anti-spam code from the backup code and add some minor improvements along the way. Offsite backups, for example, are not being rotated by daily.sh and the use of hard-links to save disk space had been planned for years but never implemented.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The current re-write implements a light-weight plug-in architecture to allow the various blocks of code to be separated from the basic backup procedure.</p>
