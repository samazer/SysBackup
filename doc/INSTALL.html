<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Please take a moment to review the <a
href="REQUIREMENTS.html"
>System Requirements</a> before installing SysBackup.

<p>At the moment there are two basic types of
installation:

<ol>

  <li><a href="BASICINSTALL.html">Basic Install</a>: The current
      server/workstation is backed-up to local (or mounted) storage.
  
  <li><a href="REMOTESTORAGE.html">SSH Remote Storage</a>: The current
      server/workstation is backed-up to remote storage via
      SSH/SCP. Optionally a copy of the backup can also be stored on
      the local (or mounted) filesystem.

</ol>

<p>You will always begin with the <a href="BASICINSTALL.html">Basic
Install</a> This is relatively quick and easy to do. The basic Install
involves mostly just the creation of various folders on the system.

<p>Setup of <a href="REMOTESTORAGE.html">SSH Remote Storage</a>
involves setting-up the SSH communications (installing the key files,)
and installing the local exec utility script on the remote server. The
Local Exec utility is included, along with a test script called Remote
Exec, in the SysBackup package.

<h3>Jobs & Plugins</h3>

<p>Once the basic software has been installed you will need to install
and enable the plugins that you want to use. At the time of this
writing there is a small collection of plugins available in the
<tt>plugin.d/</tt> folder. Hopefully that collection will grow over
time. Each plugin is a small and simple script that is designed to
perform some kind of common task. For example the mysql.plugin script
is designed to backup a MySQL database server, the mailman.plugin
script is designed to backup a mailman installation, etc.

<p>Once you get to know about the different plugins you can setup the
jobs you need to properly backup your server or workstation. Again,
setting-up the backup jobs is fairly easy. Job configuration scripts
are really just little scripts that schedule calls to the plugins.

<p>In many cases you can configure a backup process that does
everything you need to do using the plugins that are available. In
some cases you might need additional functionality. If so you can
review the code for one of the existing plugins and write a plugin to
simplify the task you are trying to complete.

<br clear='all'>

<h3>Be Prepared!</h3>

<p>SysBackup can be configued to backup specific information and
services. Installation and configuration is relatively simple. From
there the generation of a backupset is a one-step automated process.

<p>Unfortunately keeping a simple set of backups does not mean that
you are prepared for all the different information restore issues you
might face over a period of years.  For helpful hints on how to make
sure you are as prepared as possible please take a look at the <a
href="BE-PREPARED.html" target="_blank" >BE-PREPARED</a> document.
