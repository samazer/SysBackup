   This is a short introduction to SysBackup, a swiss-army-knife-type
   utility that helps simplify and organize the nightly backup tasks. It
   allows the system administrator to quickly and easily script jobs that
   tarball folders and compress files into a backup set.

The Problem

   As system administrators we are faced with a variety of problems on our
   servers from day to day. Over long periods of time we experience
   different issues with our user community and our equipment. This leads
   us to recognize a variety of different needs and, in general, try to
   meet them with little scripts. We run these little scripts every night
   in the hope that we might be better prepared for the days ahead. After
   a while, though, the scripts start to get complicated. Then, when
   disaster does strike again - and it will - we find out the hard way
   that things didn't quite work out as planned. There are always minor
   details that conspire against us (often just simple system software
   upgrades and changes in the behavior of the user community.) The
   problems also tend to happen most when we are most confident that we
   are doing what we need to be doing - which leads to much embarrassment.
   This forces us to review the backup procedure and make more
   adjustments.

The Solution

   The ultimate solution is an iterative business process combined with a
   simple but flexible collection of tools. The business process will
   include regular reviews and disaster recovery exercises to ensure that
   everything is running smoothly. What we want from the backup tool is
   to:
     * easily perform simple tasks, such as tarballing specific folders or
       collections of folders, quickly and conveniently,
     * intelligently execute common tasks such as backing-up a well-known
       service.
     * allow us to simply, quickly and easily add to and adjust the
       overall procedure in response to day-to-day issues.

   SysBackup is a swiss-army-knife-type utility that helps simplify and
   organize the nightly backup tasks. It allows the system administrator
   to quickly and easily script jobs that tarball folders and compress
   files into a backup set. The jobs are really easy to setup.

   The jobs make use of a collection of plugins that are designed to
   simplify common tasks. Some of the plugins, such as the MailMan Mailing
   List Plugin, help the administrator perform several related tasks by
   configuring one simple backup job. Some of the plugins, such as the
   MySQL plugin, understand a specific service and are able to correctly
   extract data from that service. This allows the more general SysBackup
   software to make valid tarballs from the MySQL data.

   The resulting backup sets are conveniently organized into daily, weekly
   and monthly rotations. Each backupset contains a set of sub-folders
   containing, hopefully, everything related to a particular service or
   user.

   Note that SysBackup uses plugins for such tasks as encryption of
   backupsets and SSH access to remote storage. This allows the behavior
   of SysBackup to be changed by simply making use of different plugins as
   needed. Most important: The plugins are really easy to write. If you
   need something you don't see you might find that you can script it
   yourself in a few minutes.

   Together these tools become a powerful and effective solution to the
   day-to-day problems faced by a system administrator. At the same time,
   SysBackup is simple and flexible enough that new jobs, possibly
   involving new plugins, can easily be added as new issues are
   identified.

Limitations

     * SysBackup was written for Linux. It will run fine under Cygwin or
       XAMPP and the sys-tarballs class can be configured to use zip
       instead of tar or pax. Then again there are many Windows backup
       solutions available and they tend to understand the Windows
       Registry and NTFS file attributes - issues that SysBackup makes no
       effort to address.
     * SysBackup is not a plug-and-play backup utility. You can't just
       install and run it - it won't do anything for you unless you take
       the time to think about what you need and configure the jobs and
       plugins to do what you need them to do.
     * SysBackup is not a bit-copy utility. In theory you could setup a
       job that tarballs an entire server or workstation - but that's not
       what SysBackup is designed to do. There are other solutions
       available for bit-copy operations. For example:
          + On Amazon AWS you can make bit-copies of your VM's using the
            Create Image function available through the web-based GUI.
          + On physical VM hosts you can simply take a snapshot of the
            VM's storage and compress it to create a bit-image of an
            entire server.
          + On physical workstations and servers you can boot a
            SysRescCD.org CD and use Partition Image to bit-copy an entire
            host over to network storage.

Be Prepared!

   [main-use-case.png] It's always a good idea to make some kind of backup
   - having copies of data is better than not having copies - but any
   experienced system administrator will tell you that backups are not, by
   themselves, very useful. Blindly running a backup utility is not the
   same as being prepared for the day-to-day issues that your organization
   will face over a period of years.

   The goal of any serious backup process is to be prepared. An
   experienced system administrator wants to make sure that any piece of
   equipment (server or workstation) is setup so that users will be able
   to get what they need, when they need it, for different types of
   restore operations. This often means being able to go back in time and:
     * find copies of files that users have accidentally changed or
       deleted (sometimes undetected for days, weeks or months,)
     * help users recover from long-term data value degradation caused by
       malware and software bugs,
     * restore a service or services that have been damaged by software
       upgrades,
     * migrate a server to a new host,
     * comply with regulations concerning long-term storage of data
     * and respond to regulatory agency requests for otherwise expired
       information.

   SysBackup is a simple, flexible and efficient tool that you can use to
   help you get the results you need - but only if you plan the process,
   test it and adjust it to ensure that you are, in fact, getting what you
   need!
