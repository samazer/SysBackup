  Overview

                                                           /etc/sysbackup/

                                                                 +-- .ssh/

                                                                 \-- temp/
                                                                 /var/log/
                                                       \-- remote-exec.log

   The procedure for sending your backupsets to a remote storage server
   via SSH is similar to the procedure for setting-up SysBackup on your
   server or workstation. It consists mainly of installing SysBackup on
   the remote storage server. You will need two password-less SSH keys:
   one for using SCP to copy files and the other for calls to the
   localexec utility. localexec is designed to execute standard PHP
   filesystem functions and return results that can easily be scanned.

   Note that the remote storage of backupsets is managed in exactly the
   same way as local storage - hardlinks are used to save disk space
   whenever possible between identical files and backupsets are pruned to
   keep a limited number of daily, weekly and monthly backupsets in
   rotation.

  Let's get started

                                                    [12]SSH Remote Storage
                                                             [13]First Run
                                                          [14]Be Prepared!

    1. Start by unpacking the SysBackup package. Again, for this example
       we will be keeping the SysBackup files in /opt/sysbackup/.
    2. Create a new user called sysbackup, ie: sudo useradd -m sysbackup.
    3. Create a temp storage folder such as /home/sysbackup/temp.
       Note that, in practice, the temporary files folder is not used very
       much by the SysBackup software and will probably never need much
       disk space - you should not have to worry about where you choose to
       put it.
    4. Create a storage folder for your daily backups. For this example we
       will use /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/daily.
       Keep in mind that you will need enough disk space on the underlying
       partition to store all the backupsets in your daily rotation for
       this server.
    5. If you plan to keep weekly and monthly rotations you will need to
       create folders for those also. For now we will assume
       /home/sysbacup/test.azertech.net/weekly/ and
       /home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/monthly.
       Again, the major consideration when setting-up the weekly and
       monthly backupset rotations will be disk space. It's important to
       carefully calculate the disk space you will need and make sure you
       have enough space available for the number of backupsets that you
       plan to keep in rotation.
    6. In ~sysbackup/.ssh/ create two ssh keys:


$ ssh-keygen -f localexec
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in localexec.
Your public key has been saved in localexec.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
1b:12:c3:01:1a:93:2b:42:43:a1:6a:db:64:98:45:78 sysbackup at nas.azertech.net
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|.o=o...          |
|.+oE . .         |
|o +o  +          |
|+ =    o         |
|o= o  . S        |
|. =    . o       |
| . .    .        |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+

$ ssh-keygen -f filecopy
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in filecopy.
Your public key has been saved in filecopy.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
b4:61:ed:2d:68:cb:87:1b:5f:ce:a1:5f:18:a1:f2:ef sysbackup at dev.azertech.net
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|         .       |
|        + . .    |
|       o = o .   |
|        S + o    |
|       o = . o   |
|        = o + .  |
|         = * o   |
|        . ooE    |
+-----------------+


       Note that, for general convenience, there are no passphrases used
       in the above example.
    7. Next, add the public keys to the authorized_keys2 file:

$ echo 'command="/opt/sysbackup-v3.01a/localexec $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ' \
               `cat localexec.pub` >> ~sysbackup/.ssh/authorized_keys2
$ cat filecopy.pub >> ~sysbackup/.ssh/authorized_keys2

       Note that the localexec key triggers the localexec utility. The
       SysBackup code will not work unless this is done. Check the
       documentation for OpenSSH for additional information about keys and
       local commands. Google for help with setting-up chrooted OpenSSH
       user accounts.
    8. Copy the private keys to the /etc/sysbackup/keys/ folder on
       test.azertech.net.
    9. Next you will need to configure SysBackup. The configuration
       information is not actually used by the localexec utility - it is
       loaded into the server which is executing the backup
       (test.azertech.net in this example.) Edit the file
       /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf on each new sshremote server. The file
       should contain the following information:

path_temp=/home/sysbackup/temp/
path_daily=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/
path_weekly=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/
path_monthly=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/

       Remember to change the /home/sysbackup path to reflect the path
       that you are really using on your sshremote server. The SysBackup
       utility will replace the %HOST% token with the host name of the
       server being backed-up.
   10. localexec has the ability to log all activity. To enable the log
       simply create it and localexec will see it and write to it each
       time it is called:

$ sudo touch /var/log/remote-exec.log
$ sudo chmod 666 /var/log/remote-exec.log

       The chmod command above is only necessary if you plan on running
       localexec without root permissions.
       At the time of this writing there is no configuration option for
       changing the location of the log file - you will have to edit the
       code for now if you need to change the log file location.
   11. Verify the setup of the sshremote server by using the remexec test
       utility on test.azertech.net. The command below will read the
       /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf file on the remote storage server and
       display it to the console. The result should look something like
       this:

$ /opt/sysbackup/remexec /etc/sysbackup/keys/localexec \
                            sysbackup@nas.azertech.net \
                            readfile /etc/sysbackup-nas.conf
path_temp=/home/sysbackup/temp/
path_daily=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/
path_weekly=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/
path_monthly=/home/sysbackup/%HOST%/daily/

   12. Edit /etc/sysbackup/sysbackup.conf on test.azertech.net to include
       the new sshremote server.

$this->add_remote( "nas", new backupvfs_sshremote_c( $this, array(
   "enabled"               => true,
   "remote_server"         => "nas.azertech.net",
   "remconf_file"          => "/etc/sysbackup-nas.conf",
   "usehardlinks"          => true,
   "ssh_localexec_keypath" => "/etc/sysbackup/keys/localexec",
   "ssh_localexec_userid"  => "sysbackup",
   "scp_filecopy_keypath"  => "/etc/sysbackup/keys/filecopy",
   "scp_filecopy_userid"   => "sysbackup",
   "rotation_enabled"      => true,
   "rotation_dayofweek"    => 0, // day of week (0=sunday, 1=monday...) for week
ly rotation
   "rotation_dayofmonth"   => 1, // day of month for monthly rotation
   "rotation_total_daily"  => 7, // total number of daily backups to keep
   "rotation_total_weekly" => 4, // total number of weekly backups to keep
   "rotation_total_monthly"=> 4, // total number of monthly backups to keep
                                                                  )));

   Finally, (again on the server that you want to backup - in this example
   it's test.azertech.net,) run SysBackup with the --dump-config option to
   see if you've done everything correctly. If everything is okay you will
   get a nice dump that will look similar to the following:

$ sudo /opt/sysbackup/sysbackup --dump-config

System Backups 3.01(alpha)

Basic Application Settings:
  req app_title                "System Backups"
  req app_version              "3.01(alpha)"
  req app_conffile             "/etc/sysbackup/sysbackup.conf"
  req app_confdir              "/etc/sysbackup/conf.d/"
  req app_plugindir            "/etc/sysbackup/plugin.d/"
  req admin_email              "sysbackup[at]azertech.net"

...

  req hostname                 "test.azertech.net"

  req keeplocal                bool(true)

  req path_temp                "/home/sysbackup/temp/"

  req path_backup              "/home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/daily/"

  req path_rotation            "/home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/"


SSH Remote Fileio VFS Plugin
  req hostname                 "nas.azertech.net"

  req keeplocal                bool(true)

  req path_temp                "/home/sysbackup/temp/"

  req path_backup              "/home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/daily/"

  req path_rotation            "/home/sysbackup/test.azertech.net/"


  req enabled                  bool(true)
  req usehardlinks             bool(true)
  req remconf_file             "/etc/sysbackup-nas.conf"
  def ssh_binary               "/usr/bin/ssh"
  int ssh_localexec_keypath    "/etc/sysbackup/keys/localexec"
  opt ssh_localexec_options    string(blank)
  int ssh_localexec_userid     "sysbackup"
  def scp_binary               "/usr/bin/scp"
  int scp_filecopy_keypath     "/etc/sysbackup/keys/filecopy"
  opt scp_filecopy_options     "-B -p -q"
  int scp_filecopy_userid      "sysbackup"
  int remote_server            "nas.azertech.net"

...


   At this point your remote server is ready for action. You will want to
   repeat the above steps for any other remote server you need. If you are
   backing-up a Virtual Machine you will want to backup the VM to the
   physical host and at least one onsite or offsite remote host.)
